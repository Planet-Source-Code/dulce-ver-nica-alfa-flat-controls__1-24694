please register vbwSubclass.dll if the project doesn't work. (www.vbweb.co.uk)

Sorry but the option button is still in development... :(
The option button class is still very buggy.

Please help me in the option buttons. (joao-dias@usa.net)

Some of this code isn't mine:
please visit www.vbAccelerator.com
I only add the checkboxes, optionbuttons and altered some of the drawing routines.

Bugs:
The option button doesn't draw sometimes and interferes with checkboxes drawing (I don't know why)
